Utilized Convolution Neural Network architecture with transfer learning to build a classification model for detecting car damages, using VGG16.
Extracted features from images, using VGG16 weights.
Leveraged different machine learning algorithms to build classification models (random forest, logistic regression).
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on image data.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of New York Police Department Civil Service Jobs Using Spark</title><link>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/post/spark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/post/spark/</guid><description>Processed data using Map transformation and filters. Carried out aggregation using different transformation techniques and MapReduce. Exploratory Data Analysis. Utilized Data Bricks File System(DBFS) as the data storage tool. Motivation The difficulty with recruitment within the law enforcement agency in the United States has caused a significant problem that is broadly affecting the police department. The civil service is an independent body that works with the government by providing different services to the people including employment.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/about/</guid><description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Olasunkanmi Daramola, a Data scientist currently based in the UK.
I love making sense out of data, performing data analysis and building dashboards to answer business questions.With a background in statistics, i understand how to use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to find hidden patterns in data.
I&amp;rsquo;m open to Job opportunities where i can contribute, learn and grow. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to relocate anywhere within the UK.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/contact/</guid><description>This is an example of a custom shortcode that you can put right into your content.
