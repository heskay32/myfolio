title: "Car Damage Inspection Using Deep Learning"
---
 
* A web application that allows users to upload their car pictures for damage inspection in order to facilitate their car insurance claim. 

* Utilized Convolution Neural Network architecture with transfer learning to build a classification
model for detecting car damages, using VGG16.

* Extracted features from images, using VGG16 weights.

* Leveraged different machine learning algorithms to build classification models (random forest,
logistic regression).

* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on image data.

* Collected image data through web scraping..

* Utilized Django web framework to develop a web application for users.
