Hello! I'm Olasunkanmi Daramola, a Data scientist currently based in the UK.

I love making sense out of data, performing data analysis and building dashboards to answer business questions.With a background in statistics, i understand how to use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to find hidden patterns in data.

I'm open to Job opportunities where i can contribute, learn and grow. I'm willing to relocate anywhere within the UK.
