Utilized Convolution Neural Network architecture with transfer learning to build a classification model for detecting car damages, using VGG16.
Extracted features from images, using VGG16 weights.
Leveraged different machine learning algorithms to build classification models (random forest, logistic regression).
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on image data.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of New York Police Department Civil Service Jobs Using Spark</title><link>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/post/spark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/post/spark/</guid><description>Processed data using Map transformation and filters. Carried out aggregation using different transformation techniques and MapReduce. Exploratory Data Analysis. Utilized Data Bricks File System(DBFS) as the data storage tool. Motivation The difficulty with recruitment within the law enforcement agency in the United States has caused a significant problem that is broadly affecting the police department. The civil service is an independent body that works with the government by providing different services to the people including employment.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning With Spark</title><link>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/post/machinelearning-spark/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 11:14:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://heskay32.github.io/myfolio/post/machinelearning-spark/</guid><description>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job. Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</description></item></channel></rss>
